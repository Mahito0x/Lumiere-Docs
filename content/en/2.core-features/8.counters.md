| `{goal}` | Target number | `500` |
| `{server}` | Server name | `My Server` |

## Customization

### Templates

Use `{count}` as placeholder for the number:

::code-group
```bash [Basic]
# Default formatting
Members: 150

# With emoji
👥 Members: 150

# With decoration
╭─ Members: 150 ─╮
```

```bash [With Goals]
# Inline goal (before reached)
Members: 450/500

# After goal reached
Members: 502

# Separate goal channel
🎯 Goal: Members Only: 450/500
```

```bash [Creative]
# Stats style
📊 Population: 150

# Minimalist
150 humans

# Detailed
👥 Active Members: 150
```
::

::tip
**Template Tips:**
- Keep under 100 characters
- Use clear, readable text
- Avoid special characters (auto-filtered)
- `{count}` is replaced automatically
::

### Channel Types

| Type | Best For | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Voice** | General stats | Recommended visible but non-interactive |
| **Text** | Detailed info | Can send messages |
| **Stage** | Premium servers | Level 3 boost required |
| **Category** | Organization | Acts as folder |
| **Announcement** | News-style | Can be followed |

---

## Permissions

### Required Permissions

::badge{type="warning"}
Manage Channels
::

**User:** Needed to create, edit, and delete counters

**Bot:** Requires these permissions in the category/server:
- **Manage Channels** - Update channel names
- **View Channel** - Read channel info
- **Send Messages** - For text channels
- **Connect** - For voice channels

::warning
If bot lacks **Manage Channels** in a category, counters in that category will fail to update.
::

### Special Requirements

| Counter Type | Additional Permission |
|--------------|----------------------|
| **Banned Members** | Bot needs **Ban Members** |
| **All Others** | Standard permissions only |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Counter not updating"}
  **Causes:**
  - Recent manual update (10-minute wait)
  - Bot lacks **Manage Channels** permission
  - Discord rate limit (2 updates per 10 min per channel)
  
  **Fix:**
  1. Check bot permissions in channel/category
  2. Wait 10 minutes before manual refresh
  3. Verify bot role is above channel in hierarchy
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Can't create counter - limit reached"}
  **Error:** "Maximum of 5 active counters"
  
  **Fix:** Delete unused counters with `/counter delete` before creating new ones
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Role-based counter shows 0"}
  **Causes:**
  - Role was deleted
  - Wrong role ID/name provided
  - Bot lacks member cache (large servers)
  
  **Fix:**
  1. Verify role exists: `/counter edit` with correct role
  2. Check role ID is correct
  3. For large servers (1000+ members), use simpler counter types
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Goal not triggering"}
  **Checklist:**
  - Current count must be **below** goal when set
  - Bot needs **Send Messages** + **Embed Links** in celebration channel
  - Counter must be actively updating
  - Goal channels not manually deleted
  
  **Fix:** Use `/counter goal-status` to verify setup
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Counter showing wrong count"}
  **For Online/Offline counters:**
  - Relies on member cache (may be approximate on large servers)
  
  **For Banned Members:**
  - Bot needs **Ban Members** permission
  
  **Fix:** Use `/counter refresh` to force recalculation
  ::

## Best Practices

### Server Organization

::card-group
  ::card{icon="i-lucide-folder"}
  **Use Categories**
  
  Create a "📊 Statistics" category to group all counters together
  ::

  ::card{icon="i-lucide-layout"}
  **Consistent Naming**
  
  Use matching emoji/formatting across all counters for visual cohesion
  ::

  ::card{icon="i-lucide-eye-off"}
  **Permission Setup**
  
  Lock counters to prevent users from joining/messaging
  ::
::

### Performance Tips

::list{icon="i-lucide-zap"}
- **Avoid role-based counters on 1000+ member servers** (slow member iteration)
- **Use voice channels** for best performance and visibility
- **Limit to 3-4 counters** per server for optimal update speed
- **Don't manually edit counter channels** (bot will revert changes)
::

### Goal Strategy

::tip
**Effective Goals:**
- Set realistic targets (20-30% above current)
- Use engaging celebration messages with placeholders
- Choose high-traffic channels for announcements
- Separate display mode for prominent tracking

## FAQ

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Why voice channels for counters?"}
  Voice channels are:
  - Counters look good in VC
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Can I have multiple goals?"}
  No. Only one active goal per server to keep celebrations special and avoid spam.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Do counters work across all servers?"}
  No. Each server has independent counters (max 5 per server).
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="What happens if I delete a counter channel manually?"}
  The counter is automatically removed from the database on next update cycle. No ghost counters.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Can I stop counter auto-updates?"}
  No. Counters update every 5 minutes automatically. To stop updates, delete the counter with `/counter delete`.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Why does my counter show 0 for role tracking?"}
  The role was likely deleted or renamed. Edit the counter with the correct role: `/counter edit`.
  ::
