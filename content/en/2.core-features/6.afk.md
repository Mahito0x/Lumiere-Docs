Let your server know when you're away. The Bot will automatically manage your status, update your nickname with `[AFK]`, and notify others when they mention you.

::callout{icon="i-lucide-zap" color="blue"}
**Auto-Return**: Your status is automatically removed when you send a message or join a voice chat.

## Setting Your Status

### Basic Usage
```bash
/afk set reason:Taking a break
```

**What happens:**
1. The `[AFK]` prefix will be added to your nickname.
2. Your reason will be saved with a timestamp.
3. Others will be notified when they mention you.
4. Your status will be cleared automatically when you return.

## How It Works

### Automatic Features

::steps
### 1. Status Activation
When you use `/afk set`, your nickname will get the `[AFK]` prefix, and your reason will be stored.

### 2. Notifications
When someone mentions you, they will see:
```
⏰ @Username has been AFK for 2 hours.
Reason: Taking a lunch break
```

### 3. Auto-Return
Your status will be cleared when you:
- Send any message (a 👋 reaction will be added).
- Join or switch voice channels.
::

### Smart Rate Limiting

::tip
To prevent spam, each person will only get one notification about your status per minute.

## Moderator Tools

### View All AFK Users
```bash
/afk list
```

This will show a paginated list of all AFK users with their reasons and timestamps (10 users per page).

### Manage Statuses

::tabs
  ::div{label="Clear Individual"}
```bash
  /afk clear user:@username
```
  This will remove the AFK status for a specific user.
  ::

  ::div{label="Clear All"}
```bash
  /afk clearall
```
  This will remove all AFK statuses server-wide. This is useful for before events or maintenance.

## Permissions

### Required Permissions

| Role | Permissions | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Any User** | None | To set their own status. |
| **Moderators** | Manage Server | To view or clear other users' statuses. |
| **Bot** | Manage Nicknames | To update users' nicknames. |

::note
**Role Hierarchy**: The Bot can only change the nicknames of users with roles lower than its own. The AFK status will still work without the nickname change.
::

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="My nickname did not change."}
  **Cause**: The Bot lacks the required permissions, or your role is higher than the Bot's role.
  
  **Solution**: Your AFK status will still work! The only thing missing is the visual `[AFK]` indicator. Check the Bot's role position and permissions.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="I can't set a reason with a link."}
  **Error**: "You cannot include invite links or mass mentions in your AFK reason."
  
  **Solution**: Remove any discord.gg links and @everyone/@here mentions. Please use plain text only.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="I am getting a cooldown message."}
  **Command Cooldowns:**
  - `/afk set`: 30 seconds
  - `/afk list`: 10 seconds
  - `/afk clear`/`/clearall`: 30 seconds
  
  **Solution**: Please wait and try again.

### Quick Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| My status will not clear. | Send any message or join a voice channel. |
| I want to update my reason. | Use `/afk set` again with the new reason. |
| There is a false status for someone. | Use `/afk clear user:@them`. |

## FAQ

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Does my AFK status work across servers?"}
  No. Your AFK status is server-specific, so each server will track your status separately.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Can I stay AFK forever?"}
  Yes. There is no time limit. Your status will remain until you return or a moderator clears it.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Why do I only get one notification?"}
  This is due to rate limiting, which prevents spam. Each person will only see your AFK status once per minute when they mention you.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="What data is stored?"}
  We only store your User ID, Server ID, your AFK reason (max 100 characters), and a timestamp. This data is deleted as soon as your AFK status is cleared.
