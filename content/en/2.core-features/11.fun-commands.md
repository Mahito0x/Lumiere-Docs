## FAQ

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Do stats carry across servers?"}
  No. Each server has independent stats and leaderboards.
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Can I disable specific commands?"}
  Use Discord's command permissions in **Server Settings → Integrations**.
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Why do GIFs sometimes fail?"}
  External API timeouts. Commands still work without GIFs.
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Math expressions in GTN?"}
  Supported: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`
  Not supported: Functions like `sqrt()` or variables
