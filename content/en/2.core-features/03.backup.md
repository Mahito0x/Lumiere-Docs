## Creating Backups

### Manual Backup

1. Run `/backup create`
2. Select components to backup
3. Confirm creation
4. Backup ID provided

::tip
**Optional name:** Add `backup_name:My Backup` to customize the name.
::

### Component Selection

You can backup:
- **All Components** - Everything in one backup
- **Individual Components** - Choose specific items (roles, channels, etc.)

### Backup Limits

- **1 backup per server** per user
- New backups overwrite old ones for the same server
- Compressed storage (minimal database load)

---

## Restoring Backups

### Prerequisites

::warning
**Bot must have:**
- **Highest role** in server hierarchy
- **Administrator permission**

These are required for successful restoration.
::



### Restoration Process

1. Run `/backup load backup_id`
2. Select components to restore
3. Review actions (deletions + creations)
4. Confirm restoration
5. Wait for completion (progress tracked)

### What Happens During Restoration

**Destructive Actions:**
- Existing roles → Deleted
- Existing channels → Deleted
- Existing emojis/stickers → Deleted
- Existing threads → Archived

**Then:**
- Selected backup components → Created/Restored

::danger
**This cannot be undone.** Always confirm you're restoring the correct backup.
::

## Scheduled Backups

### Setup

```bash
# Enable daily backups
/backup interval on interval:Daily

# Check schedule
/backup interval show

# Disable
/backup interval off
```

### Intervals

- **Daily** - Every 24 hours
- **Weekly** - Every 7 days
- **Monthly** - Every 30 days

### Behavior

- Scheduled backups **overwrite** previous ones (1 backup rule)
- Backs up **all components** automatically
- Runs in background
- Timestamps tracked in `/backup interval show`

| Action | Permission |
|--------|------------|
| Create Backup | Administrator |
| View Backups | None (own backups) |
| Restore Backup | Administrator |
| Delete Backup | None (own backups) |

## Best Practices

::tip
**Before Restoring:**
1. Create a fresh backup of target server
2. Verify bot has highest role + admin
3. Disable protection bots temporarily
4. Test in staging server first (if available)
5. Inform members about downtime
::

::tip
**Backup Strategy:**
- Manual backup before major changes
- Enable scheduled backups (weekly recommended)
- Keep backups organized with clear names
- Regularly verify backup contents with `/backup info`
::

## Troubleshooting

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Backup creation failed"}
  **Causes:**
  - Missing bot permissions
  - Rate limits (too many API calls)
  - Large server (pins/emojis timeout)
  
  **Fix:**
  - Verify all required permissions
  - Wait and retry
  - Create backup without pins/emojis first
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Restoration stuck/slow"}
  **Normal Behavior:**
  - Large servers take 10-30 minutes
  - Emojis/stickers are slowest (rate limits)
  
  **If Actually Stuck:**
  - Use `/backup status` to check progress
  - Use `/backup cancel` if needed
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Bot lacks Administrator permission"}
  **Why Required:**
  - Role hierarchy management
  - Channel overwrites
  - Comprehensive restoration
  
  **Grant Temporarily:**
  - Give Administrator for restoration
  - Revoke after completion
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Protection bot blocked restoration"}
  **Solution:**
  - Temporarily disable protection bots
  - Whitelist Lumière Bot
  - Complete restoration
  - Re-enable protection bots
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="My scheduled backup didn't run"}
  **Check:**
  - `/backup interval show` - Is it enabled?
  - Bot was online at scheduled time?
  
  **Fix:**
  - Re-enable with `/backup interval on`
  - Verify bot stays online

## FAQ

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Can I have multiple backups per server?"}
  No. we enforce **1 backup per server per user**. Each new backup overwrites the previous one to optimize storage.
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="What happens to messages?"}
  Only **pinned messages** are backed up (up to 10 per channel/thread). Regular messages are **not** backed up.
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Can I restore to a different server?"}
  Yes! You can restore any backup to any server where you have Administrator permission.
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="How long are backups stored?"}
  Indefinitely until:
  - You delete them manually
  - They're overwritten by a new backup for the same server
  - You purge all backups
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Can I restore partial backups?"}
  Yes! When restoring, you can select **specific components** to restore. You don't have to restore everything.
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="What if restoration fails midway?"}
  The server will be left partially restored. You'll need to:
  1. Check `/backup status` to see where it stopped
  2. Either manually fix issues or restore again
  3. Contact support if persistent issues
