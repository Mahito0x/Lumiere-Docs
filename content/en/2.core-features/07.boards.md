::tip
**What's a Board?** A board automatically posts messages to a designated channel when they reach a certain number of reactions—like a hall of fame (or shame) for your server.
::

## Overview

Boards help you curate and highlight the best content in your server automatically.

**The Workflow:**
User Reacts 🤣 ➝ Threshold Met (e.g., 5+) ➝ Bot Posts to Board 📌

### Why use Boards?

* **Showcase Top Content** – Automatically highlight the community's best messages or "hall of fame" moments.
* **Themed Collections** – Organize content by type, such as Art Boards, Meme Channels, or Skullboards.
* **Staff Picks** – Allow moderators to "pin" or feature important announcements to a specific channel.
* **Drive Engagement** – Encourage users to react more frequently to get their friends featured.

## Board Management

### Edit Boards

```bash
/board edit board: Starboard threshold: 10
/board edit board: Starboard channel: #new-starboard
/board edit board: Starboard emojis: ⭐ 🌟 ✨
/board edit board: Starboard name: Hall of Fame

```

### Enable/Disable Boards

```bash
/board disable board: Starboard
/board enable board: Starboard

```

### Delete or Reset Boards

```bash
/board delete board: Starboard   # Permanent
/board reset board: Starboard    # Clears posts but keeps settings

```

---

## Advanced Filtering

### Self-Star

```bash
/board selfstar board: Starboard enabled: true|false

```

### Filters

* **Channels/Roles/Users** – Whitelist or blacklist using `/board filter`
* Example: Add channel or role, remove as needed
* View active filters:

```bash
/board filters board: Starboard

```

* Clear filters:

```bash
/board clearfilters board: Starboard

```

---

## Default Settings

Set server-wide defaults for all new boards:

```bash
/board defaults set threshold: 10 selfstar: false
/board defaults filter filter_type: Whitelist Channels action: Add channels: #general
/board defaults view
/board defaults clear
/board defaults reset

```

---

## Statistics & Leaderboards

```bash
/board stats board: Starboard
/board leaderboard type: User|Message [world: true]

```

* Shows total posts, reactions, top messages/users, server or global ranking

---

## How Boards Work

* Boards update automatically as reactions change
* Posts include message, author, reactions, attachments, and jump link
* Posts are removed if reactions drop below threshold
* Multiple emojis on a board all count toward the threshold

---

## Common Use Cases

```bash
# Starboard
/board create name: Starboard channel: #starboard emojis: ⭐ threshold: 5 selfstar: false

# Meme Board
/board create name: Memes channel: #top-memes emojis: 😂 🤣 💀 threshold: 10

# Art Showcase
/board create name: Art Gallery channel: #gallery emojis: 🎨 threshold: 3
/board filter board: Art Gallery filter_type: Whitelist Channels action: Add channels: #art

# Skullboard
/board create name: Skullboard channel: #cringe emojis: 💀 threshold: 7

```

---

## Best Practices

* **Threshold:** Low (1–3) = active, Medium (5–10) = balanced, High (15+) = exclusive
* **Filters:** Use whitelist for strict control, blacklist for open control, avoid combining both on same type
* **Self-Star:** Enable for creative/self-promo boards, disable for competitive boards

---

## Troubleshooting

* Check board status: `/board list`
* Filters may block posts
* Bot needs Send Messages + Embed Links permissions
* Posts auto-remove below threshold
