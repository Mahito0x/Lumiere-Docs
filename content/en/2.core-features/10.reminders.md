Advanced reminder system with natural language time parsing, timezone awareness, and flexible delivery options.

::tip

::

---

## Overview

The reminder system delivers notifications at specific times or intervals. Supports both one-time and recurring reminders with smart delivery fallbacks.

### Key Features

- Natural language time parsing ("5m", "tomorrow 9am", "next friday")
- Timezone-aware scheduling (no more 3am reminders!)
- Smart delivery (DM with channel fallback)
- Snooze & "Remind Again" buttons
- Recurring reminders with pause/resume
- Multi-user "Count me in" feature

---

## Create Reminders

### Set Timezone (Required)

```bash
/timezone                        # View popular timezones
/timezone timezone:America/New_York  # Set specific timezone
```

**Autocomplete available** - Start typing to search all timezones.

### One-Time Reminders

```bash
/reminder add when:5m content:Check oven
/reminder add when:tomorrow 9am content:Meeting with team
/reminder add when:2025-12-25 18:00 content:Christmas dinner
```

**Time formats supported:**
- **Relative:** `5m`, `2h30m`, `1d`
- **Natural:** `in 45m`, `tomorrow 9am`, `next friday`
- **Absolute:** `2025-01-05 18:00`
- **Days:** `monday 18:00`, `next friday`

### Recurring Reminders

```bash
/reminder every time:10m content:Stretch break
/reminder every time:daily content:Daily standup
/reminder every time:weekly content:Team meeting
```

**Intervals:**
- **Simple:** `10m`, `2h`, `1d` (minimum: 1 minute)
- **Predefined:** `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`

---

## Reminder Types

### One-Time

- Triggers once at specified time
- Includes **Snooze** and **Remind Again** buttons
- Auto-deactivates after delivery

**Snooze:** Recreates reminder with same duration
**Remind Again:** Creates new reminder with same content

### Recurring

- Triggers repeatedly at set intervals
- Includes **Cancel** button to stop recurrence
- Prevents time drift (scheduled based on original time, not delivery time)
- Can be paused/resumed without losing schedule

---

## Delivery

### Delivery Options

```bash
# DM (default)
/reminder add when:5m content:Message

# Channel (where command was used)
/reminder add when:5m content:Message delivery:This Channel
```

### Smart Fallback

If DM fails (user has DMs disabled):
1. Attempts channel delivery (where reminder was created)
2. Shows fallback message: "tried DMing you… looks like you're hiding. 😏"

::warning
Channel reminders require bot to have **Send Messages** and **Embed Links** permissions.
::

### Multi-User Feature

Anyone can click **"Count me in"** button to create the same reminder for themselves (in their timezone).

---

## Manage Reminders

### View Reminders

```bash
/reminder list
```

Shows all active reminders:
- Grouped by type (recurring first, then one-time)
- Numbered for easy reference (#1, #2, etc.)
- Displays trigger time in your timezone
- Paginated (5 per page)

### Remove Reminders

```bash
/reminder remove
```

1. Select reminder(s) from dropdown (multi-select)
2. Confirm removal
3. Reminders cancelled and removed from schedule

### Pause/Resume Recurring

```bash
/reminder pause
```

**Pause:** Stops notifications temporarily (schedule preserved)
**Resume:** Continues from next scheduled time

::tip
Paused reminders won't trigger but remain in your list. Resume them anytime without losing the schedule.

## Time Handling

### Timezone Conversion

All times stored in UTC. Displayed in your configured timezone automatically.

**Example:**
- You set: `tomorrow 9am` (America/New_York)
- Bot stores: `2025-01-03 14:00:00 UTC`
- Bot displays: `Jan 3, 9:00 AM EST` to you

### DST (Daylight Saving Time)

Automatically handled! Recurring reminders adjust for DST transitions.

**Example:**
- Daily 9am reminder in timezone with DST
- Still triggers at 9am local time after DST change
- UTC time shifts automatically

### Time Drift Prevention

Recurring reminders calculate next run from **original schedule**, not current time.

**Wrong (drift):** Next = Now + Interval
**Correct (no drift):** Next = LastTrigger + Interval

This prevents accumulated delays over time.

## Failures & Edge Cases

### Common Issues

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Reminder didn't trigger"}
  **Causes:**
  - Bot was offline
  - Reminder time was in the past
  
  **Fix:**
  - Overdue reminders deliver immediately on bot restart
  - Check `/reminder list` to verify reminder exists
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Didn't receive DM"}
  **Cause:** DMs disabled
  
  **Fix:**
  - Bot automatically falls back to channel (if available)
  - Check channel where reminder was created
  - Enable DMs: User Settings → Privacy & Safety → Allow DMs from server members
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Wrong time displayed"}
  **Cause:** Incorrect timezone
  
  **Fix:**
  - Update timezone: `/timezone timezone:YourTimezone`
  - Verify current time: `/timezone` (shows your local time)
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Recurring reminder stopped"}
  **Causes:**
  - Paused manually
  - Bot was offline during trigger
  
  **Fix:**
  - Check `/reminder list` for paused status
  - Use `/reminder pause` to resume
  - Bot will skip missed occurrences and schedule next valid time
  ::
  
  ::accordion-item{label="Can't create reminder"}
  **Causes:**
  - Timezone not set
  - Time is in the past
  - Invalid time format
  
  **Fix:**
  - Set timezone: `/timezone`
  - Use future time only
  - Follow supported time formats (see [Create Reminders](#create-reminders))
  ::
::

### Duplicate Detection

Bot tracks recent reminders (5 minute window). Creating identical reminder within 5 minutes may show warning but still creates reminder.

### Missed Reminders

If bot is offline:
- **One-time:** Delivers immediately on restart
- **Recurring:** Skips missed occurrences, schedules next valid time

### Time Parsing Priority

1. **TimeParser** (intervals like "5m", "2h30m")
2. **dateparser** (natural language like "tomorrow 9am")

If both fail, shows error with supported formats.
