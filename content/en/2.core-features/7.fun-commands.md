## Tips & Best Practices

### For Server Owners

::tip
**'Guess the Number' Setup**: Place the game channel in a dedicated category to easily manage its permissions. You may also want to consider muting notifications for active game channels.
::

::tip
**Range Selection**: Start with a 1-50 range for quick games. You can increase it to 1-100 for more experienced players. Avoid extremely large ranges (e.g., 1-1000), as they can discourage participation.
::

### For Players

::card-group
  ::card{icon="i-lucide-trophy"}
  **Build Streaks**
  
  Focus on consistency over speed. A 5+ streak will unlock special achievements!
  ::

  ::card{icon="i-lucide-calculator"}
  **Use Math**
  
  You can type expressions like `50/2` or `10+15` to quickly calculate your guesses.
  ::

  ::card{icon="i-lucide-chart-line"}
  **Track Your Progress**
  
  Check your `/gtn profile` regularly to monitor your improvement.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="'Guess the Number' is not responding to guesses."}
  **Causes:**
  - You are in the wrong channel (check `/gtn stats` for the correct game channel).
  - The game is disabled (a moderator may have toggled it off).
  - The 2-second cooldown is active (wait and try again).
  
  **Fix**: Verify that the game is enabled with `/gtn set` and that you are in the correct channel.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Math expressions are not working."}
  **Supported operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` (power), `-` (negative)
  
  **Not supported**: Functions like `sqrt()` and `sin()`, or variables.
  
  **Examples**: ✅ `50/2`, `10+5*2` | ❌ `sqrt(25)`, `x+5`
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Action commands are showing an error."}
  **Self-action prevention**: You cannot use actions on yourself. Please choose another member.
  
  **Bot issues**: There may be temporary API failures. Please wait 30 seconds and try again.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="My achievements are not showing."}
  Achievements will only appear when you unlock them (the first time you meet the criteria). They are embedded in the win message, so check carefully!
  ::

## FAQ

::accordion
  ::accordion-item{label="Can multiple people guess at the same time?"}
  Yes! The game uses async locks to safely handle concurrent guesses. The first person to guess the correct number wins.
  ::tip
  However, it is best to turn on the cooldown.
  ::
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Do my 'Guess the Number' stats carry across servers?"}
  No. Each server has its own independent stats, leaderboards, and configurations.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="What happens to my streak if I make a wrong guess?"}
  Your streak will reset to 0 immediately after any incorrect guess. You can build it back up by guessing correctly!
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Why do some GIFs fail to load?"}
  External APIs occasionally time out or have rate limits. The command will still work, but there will be no GIF.
  ::

  ::accordion-item{label="Can I disable specific fun commands?"}
  Not natively. However, you can use Discord's command permissions in **Server Settings → Integrations** to disable individual commands for each role or channel.
