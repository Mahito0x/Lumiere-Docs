## Getting Started

::accordion
  :::accordion-item{label="How do I add Lumière Bot to my server?" icon="i-lucide-plus-circle"}
  Adding Lumière Bot is simple:
  
  1. Visit this [invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1296095335483179080)
  2. Select your server from the dropdown
  3. Review and authorize the required permissions
  4. Click "Authorize" and complete the captcha
  
  ::note
  **Note:** You need **Manage Server** permission to add bots to a Discord server.
  ::
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="What permissions does the Bot need?" icon="i-lucide-shield"}
  For fewer errors, granting **Administrator** is recommended.  

  
  ::tip
  If you value privacy, do not modify the permissions; the bot sets them automatically when invited.
  ::
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="How do I get started with commands?" icon="i-lucide-command"}
  Lumière Bot uses Discord's slash commands:
  
  1. Type `/` in any channel where the Bot has access
  2. Select **Lumière** from the list
  3. Browse available commands or start typing to search
  4. Fill in required parameters and press Enter
  
  ::tip
  **Pro tip:** Use `/help` to see all available commands organized by category!
  ::
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="Is Lumière Bot free to use?" icon="i-lucide-coins"}
  Yes! Lumière Bot is free to use and most features are available at no cost.  

  Don't worry we’re not going to be like *that* bot that locks everything behind a paywall. Some premium features may appear to support development, but the core functionality will always stay free.

  For full details, refer to the [AFK System](../2.core-features/6.afk.md) documentation.
  :::


  :::accordion-item{label="Can I customize the Bot's prefix or command style?" icon="i-lucide-settings"}

## Troubleshooting

::accordion
  :::accordion-item{label="The Bot isn't responding to commands. Why?" icon="i-lucide-alert-circle"}
  Try these solutions:
  
  ::steps
  ### Check Permissions
  Ensure the Bot has "Send Messages" and "Embed Links" permissions in the channel.
  
  ### Verify Bot Status
  Check if the Bot is online. If offline, wait a few minutes or check our [support server](https://discord.gg/RZP3A9dq7S) for status updates.
  
  ### Use Slash Commands
  Make sure the command you are running supports prefixes. Prefixes are limited to some commands most commands use `/`.

  ### Check Server Settings
  Discord server settings might block bots from certain channels.

  - Your server ID
  - The command you tried
  - Any error messages
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="Why can't the Bot manage messages/channels/roles?" icon="i-lucide-lock"}
  If the Bot can't manage messages, channels, or roles, it's usually due to missing permissions or role hierarchy.  

  Refer to the [Permissions](../1.getting-started/3.permissions.md) section if you're unsure.
  ::warning
  **Discord Hierarchy:** The Bot can only affect users with roles lower than its highest role.
  ::
  :::


  :::accordion-item{label="Commands are slow or timing out. What's wrong?" icon="i-lucide-clock"}
  Some commands, like fun commands and AFK, have cooldowns try not to use them too often and wait the indicated time.  

  Report persistent issues to our [support team](https://discord.gg/RZP3A9dq7S).
  :::


  :::accordion-item{label="I get an error message. What does it mean?" icon="i-lucide-x-octagon"}
  Common errors:

  - **Missing Permissions:** Bot lacks required permissions → check role permissions  
  - **Command Failed:** Internal error → try again or report  
  - **Invalid Input:** Wrong parameter format → check `/help`  
  - **Rate Limited:** Too many requests → wait 10–60 seconds  

  For other errors, join our [support server](https://discord.gg/RZP3A9dq7S) and provide the error, command, and server ID.
  :::


  :::accordion-item{label="Can I recover deleted messages or data?" icon="i-lucide-archive-restore"}
  **Short answer:** No.  

  Lumière does not store message content. Deleted messages, configs, and game stats cannot be recovered.

## Privacy & Security

::accordion
  :::accordion-item{label="What data does the Bot collect?" icon="i-lucide-database"}
  Lumière collects only what's needed for functionality: server, channel, and user IDs, command usage, and settings.  

  **Feature-specific:** Each feature collects only the data it needs to work.  

  **We NEVER collect:** message content (except command args), DMs, voice, or personal info beyond Discord IDs.  

  Read the full [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacypolicy) for details.
  :::


  :::accordion-item{label="Is my data secure?" icon="i-lucide-shield-check"}
  **Yes.** We take security seriously and follow industry-standard practices to protect your data.  

  **However:** No system is 100% secure. While we implement best practices, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="How do I delete my data?" icon="i-lucide-trash-2"}
  To delete your data, open a ticket in our [support server](https://discord.gg/RZP3A9dq7S) under the right category and contact a moderator. We'll process requests promptly.
  :::


  :::accordion-item{label="Can the Bot see my private messages?" icon="i-lucide-eye-off"}
  **Absolutely not.**  

  The Bot cannot access DMs, voice chats, or channels where it isn't present. It only sees messages in channels where it has permission and commands you run.  

  ::tip
  Command arguments are only stored temporarily; message content is never saved.
  ::
  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="Who has access to my data?" icon="i-lucide-users"}
  Only the Bot owner and authorized developers can access your data for maintenance and support.  

  We never share, sell, or use your data for marketing.  

  Read our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacypolicy) for full details.
