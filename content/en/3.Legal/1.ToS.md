**Last Updated:** December 23, 2025

By inviting or using Lumière Bot in your Discord server, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you disagree, do not use the Bot.

---

## 1. Scope of Service

### What Lumière Bot Is

Lumière Bot is a multifunctional Discord bot providing:

::list{icon="i-lucide-check"}
- **Moderation:** Purging, auto-purge, banning, kicking, and warnings
- **Server Management:** Counters, AFK status, and logging systems
- **Entertainment:** Games, actions, jokes, and memes
- **Utilities:** Reminders, information commands, and statistics
- **Automation:** Auto-moderation and scheduled tasks
::

### What It's Not

- **Not error-free** — Bugs and issues may occur despite our best efforts
- **Not guaranteed available** — Service may be interrupted for maintenance or technical issues
- **Not a substitute for human judgment** — The Bot assists but doesn't replace responsible server management
- **Not responsible for user actions** — Server owners and users are responsible for their own conduct

The Bot is provided **"as-is"** and may be updated, modified, or discontinued at our discretion.
