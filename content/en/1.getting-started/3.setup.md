# Setup Guide

Lumière is installed. Now let's make it work for your server. This guide gets you from zero to fully operational in under 5 minutes.

## First Steps

### Check Lumière's Status

Before configuring anything, verify Lumière is online and responsive:

1. Type `/` in any channel
2. Look for Lumière's commands in the slash command menu
3. Try `/help` to confirm it's working

::callout{icon="i-lucide-circle-check" color="green"}
**Commands showing up?** You're ready to configure. Let's go.

## Essential Configuration

You don't need to set up everything at once. Start with the features that matter most to your server.

### 1. Logging System (Recommended First)

Know what's happening in your server. Track joins, leaves, message edits, and deletions.

```
/logging
```

**What you'll need:**
- A dedicated logging channel (create one called `#logs` or `#mod-logs`)
- Choose which events to track (the command will guide you)

::callout{icon="i-lucide-info" color="blue"}
**Pro Tip**: Create a private channel visible only to moderators for sensitive logs.

### 2. Joineroles (High Impact, Low Effort)

Automatically assign roles to new members the instant they join.

```
/joinerole add role:@YourRole
```

**Common use cases:**
- Give everyone a "Member" role on join
- Assign initial access roles
- Add "Unverified" roles for servers with verification

::callout{icon="i-lucide-users" color="primary"}
**Why set this up?** New members get instant access to your server without manual role assignment. Zero friction onboarding.

### 3. Starboard (Community Engagement)

Let your members highlight the best content by reacting with ⭐.

```
/starboard setup channel:#starboard threshold:3
```

**What you'll configure:**
- Starboard channel (where highlighted messages appear)
- Star threshold (how many ⭐ reactions needed)
- Optional: emoji customization

::callout{icon="i-lucide-star" color="amber"}
**Popular setup**: 3-5 star threshold works well for most servers. Adjust based on your activity level.
::

### 4. TempVoice Channels (Optional but Awesome)

Let members create their own temporary voice channels that auto-delete when empty.

```
/tempvoice setup category:YourCategory
```

**What happens:**
- Users join a "Create Channel" voice channel
- Lumière instantly creates a private channel for them
- Channel deletes automatically when everyone leaves

::callout{icon="i-lucide-volume-2" color="primary"}
**Perfect for**: Study groups, gaming sessions, private conversations—no more cluttered voice channels.
::

### 5. AFK System (User Convenience)

Members can set themselves as AFK. Lumière will notify others when they're mentioned.

```
/afk set reason:Taking a break
```

**How it works:**
- User sets AFK status with optional reason
- When mentioned, Lumière responds with their AFK message
- Auto-removes AFK when they send a message

No setup required—users can start using this immediately.
