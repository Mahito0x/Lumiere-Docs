Lumière requires proper **role placement** and permissions to function. Most issues arise from **role hierarchy**: if Lumière is below a role, it cannot manage it.

## Role Hierarchy

::caution
**Place Lumière above roles it manages** (members, Joineroles) and below admin roles.
::


## Administrator Permission (Optional)

- **With Admin:** All features work instantly; hierarchy is mostly ignored.  
- **Without Admin:** Grant these permissions:

**Essential:** Manage Server, View Channels, Send Messages, Embed Links, Read Message History  
**Moderation:** Kick, Ban, Timeout, Manage Messages, Manage Nicknames, Manage Roles  
**Counters/Logs:** Manage Channels, View Audit Log  

::tip
Admin permission is recommended for simplicity and fewer errors.
::

## Channel Overrides

Ensure Lumière can:
- View Channels  
- Send Messages  
- Embed Links  

Apply overrides to logging channels as needed.

::note
Most issues are due to role hierarchy. Adjust Lumière's role first.
