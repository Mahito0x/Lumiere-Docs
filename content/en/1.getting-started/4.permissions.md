# Permissions Guide

Lumière needs specific permissions to function properly. More importantly, **role hierarchy matters**—get this wrong and features will silently fail.

## Role Hierarchy (Critical)

**This is the number one reason features break.** Discord's role hierarchy determines what Lumière can and cannot do.

### The Golden Rule

::caution
**Lumière's role MUST be positioned ABOVE any role it needs to manage.**

If Lumière's role is below a member's role, it cannot:
- Assign or remove that role
- Kick or ban that member
- Timeout that member
- Modify their nickname
- Move them between voice channels
::

### Correct Hierarchy Setup

When you invite Lumière, Discord automatically creates a role named **"Lumière"**. Here's where it should be positioned:
```
Server Role Hierarchy (Top to Bottom):
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Owner                        │ ← Server Owner (automatic)
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Admin                        │ ← Your admin roles
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Lumière                      │ ← LUMIÈRE GOES HERE
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Moderator                    │ ← Moderator roles
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Verified                     │ ← Member roles
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Member                       │ ← Default member role
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ New Member                   │ ← Lowest roles
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

::tip
**Why This Matters:**

With Lumière positioned correctly, it can:
- Assign joineroles to new members
- Log moderator actions
- Manage TempVoice channels for everyone
- Execute moderation commands on regular members
- Cannot affect admins (and shouldn't)
::

### How to Fix Role Hierarchy

1. Open **Server Settings** → **Roles**
2. **Drag "Lumière"** above all member and moderator roles
3. Keep it **below admin roles** for safety
4. Click **Save Changes**

::note
If Lumière has Administrator permission, hierarchy is ignored for most actions—but you should still position it correctly for clarity and organization.
::

## Administrator Permission

During installation, you were offered Administrator permission. Here's what it means:

### With Administrator

**Advantages:**
- Every feature works instantly, no configuration needed
- Bypasses most role hierarchy restrictions
- No permission-related errors or silent failures
- Future features automatically work

**Considerations:**
- Lumière can do anything except manage roles above it
- Requires trust in the bot (like any admin-level tool)

::tip
**Recommended for most servers.** Saves time, prevents issues, and mirrors how you'd set up other trusted bots like MEE6, Dyno, or Carl-bot.
::

### Without Administrator

**You'll need to manually grant these permissions:**

#### Essential Permissions (Required)
- **Manage Server** — Access server settings for setup
- **View Channels** — See all channels for logging
- **Send Messages** — Respond to commands and send logs
- **Embed Links** — Display rich embeds
- **Attach Files** — Send images and logs
- **Read Message History** — Track message edits/deletes
- **Use External Emojis** — Display custom emojis
- **Add Reactions** — React to messages (Starboard)
- **Use Slash Commands** — Execute commands

#### Feature-Specific Permissions

**For Logging System:**
- **View Audit Log** — Track who did what
- **Read Message History** — Monitor message changes

**For Moderation:**
- **Kick Members** — Execute kick commands
- **Ban Members** — Execute ban commands
- **Timeout Members** — Mute users temporarily
- **Manage Messages** — Delete messages if needed
- **Manage Nicknames** — Change member nicknames

**For Joineroles:**
- **Manage Roles** — Assign roles to new members

**For TempVoice:**
- **Manage Channels** — Create/delete voice channels
- **Move Members** — Move users between channels
- **Connect** — Join voice channels
- **Speak** — Play audio (if needed)

**For Counters:**
- **Manage Channels** — Edit channel names for counters

## Permission Troubleshooting

### "Lumière isn't assigning joineroles"

**Most likely cause:** Role hierarchy issue.

1. Check if Lumière's role is above the role you're trying to assign
2. Verify Lumière has **Manage Roles** permission
3. Test with a lower-positioned role first

### "Logging isn't capturing moderator actions"

**Most likely cause:** Missing View Audit Log permission.

1. Grant Lumière **View Audit Log** in Server Settings → Roles
2. Ensure Lumière can **View Channels** in the logging channel

### "TempVoice channels aren't being created"

**Most likely cause:** Missing Manage Channels permission.

1. Verify Lumière has **Manage Channels** globally
2. Check category-specific permissions
3. Ensure Lumière's role is positioned correctly

### "Moderation commands say 'Missing Permissions'"

**Two possible causes:**

1. **You don't have permission** — You need the same permission to use the command
2. **Lumière can't target that user** — Their role is higher than Lumière's

### "Features work sometimes but not always"

**Classic hierarchy problem.** Lumière can manage some users but not others because their roles are positioned differently.

**Solution:** Move Lumière's role higher in the hierarchy.

## Channel-Specific Permissions

Some channels might have permission overrides that block Lumière even if it has the permission globally.

### Required Channel Permissions

For Lumière to work in any channel, it needs:
- **View Channel** — See the channel exists
- **Send Messages** — Respond to commands
- **Embed Links** — Display formatted responses

### Logging Channel Setup

Your logging channel should have:
```
✓ Lumière: View Channel, Send Messages, Embed Links
✗ @everyone: View Channel (denied)
✓ Moderators: View Channel
```

This keeps logs private while letting Lumière post to them.

### TempVoice Category Setup

The category where TempVoice creates channels needs:
```
✓ Lumière: Manage Channels, Connect, Move Members
✓ @everyone: Connect (so members can join)
```

## Security Best Practices

::warning
**Keeping Your Server Safe**

Even with Administrator permission, Lumière follows these safeguards:
- Cannot delete your server
- Cannot transfer ownership
- Cannot manage roles higher than its own
- All actions are logged in Discord's Audit Log
::

### Recommended Security Setup

1. **Give Lumière Administrator** for convenience
2. **Position it below admins** so it can't affect them
3. **Keep admin roles limited** to trusted staff only
4. **Monitor Audit Logs** for any unexpected actions
5. **Use role hierarchy** as a safety net

## Quick Permission Checklist

Use this checklist after installation:

- [ ] Lumière role positioned above member roles
- [ ] Lumière role below admin roles
- [ ] Administrator granted (recommended) OR all required permissions enabled
- [ ] Lumière can view all channels (or channels where it's needed)
- [ ] Logging channel allows Lumière to send messages
- [ ] TempVoice category allows Lumière to manage channels
- [ ] Test joineroles with a new member or alt account
- [ ] Test logging by editing/deleting a message
- [ ] Test TempVoice by joining the creation channel

## Still Having Permission Issues?

If features still aren't working after following this guide:

1. **Check Audit Log** — See if Discord is blocking actions
2. **Test with Administrator** — Temporarily enable it to rule out permission issues
3. **Review channel overrides** — Specific channels might block Lumière
4. **Join Support Server** — [Get help from our team](https://discord.gg/RZP3A9dq7S)

::note
**Remember:** 90% of permission problems are hierarchy issues. Move Lumière's role higher and most problems vanish.
