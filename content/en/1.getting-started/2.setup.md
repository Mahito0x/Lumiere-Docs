  description: Step-by-step guide to configure Lumière's logging, moderation, auto-roles, and essential settings using slash commands.

# Initial Configuration

Lumière is configured through **slash commands** (`/`) with limited prefix support for certain commands. Follow these steps to get your server up and running.

::tip
**Important**: Complete the essential configuration steps immediately after inviting Lumière to ensure full functionality and optimal moderation performance.
::

## Essential Setup

### 1. Moderation Visibility

Control whether moderator names are shown when users receive moderation actions via DM. **By default**, moderator names are shown.

```bash
/modvisibility visible: true
```

- `true` - Shows moderator names in DM notifications
- `false` - Hides moderator names (anonymous moderation)

---

### 2. Auto-Role for New Members

Automatically assign roles to new members and bots when they join. Configure up to 5 roles for each category.

::code-group
```bash [Members and Bots]
/autorole set member: @Member @Member2 bot: @Bot-Role
```
```bash [Members Only]
/autorole set member: @Member @Member2 @Member3
```
```bash [Bots Only]
/autorole set bot: @Bot-Role @Bot-Role2
```
::

**View current configuration**: 
```bash
/autorole view
```

**Remove specific roles**:
::code-group
```bash [Remove Member Roles]
/autorole remove member: @Member @Member2
```
```bash [Remove Bot Roles]
/autorole remove bot: @Bot-Role
```
```bash [Remove Both]
/autorole remove member: @Member bot: @Bot-Role
```
::

::tip
**Auto-Sync Feature**  
Lumière automatically syncs auto-roles every 5 minutes to ensure all existing members have the configured roles, not just new joiners.
::

::warning
**Role Hierarchy Requirements**  
- Lumière's role must be **above** all auto-roles in the server settings
- Managed roles (integration roles) cannot be assigned as auto-roles
- You can assign up to **5 roles** per category (members/bots)
::

### 3. Custom Prefix (Optional)

Set a custom text prefix for hybrid commands. The prefix must be 5 characters or less and cannot be empty or whitespace.

**View current prefix:**
::code-group
```bash [Prefix Command]
.prefix
```
```bash [Slash Command]
/prefix
```
::

**Set a new prefix:**
::code-group
```bash [Prefix Command]
prefix .
```
```bash [Slash Command]
/prefix prefix: !
```
::

::tip
**Hybrid Command Support**  
This command works with both text prefix and slash command syntax. Your custom prefix applies to all hybrid commands in the server.
::

::warning
**Requirements**  
- Requires **Manage Server** permission
- Prefix must be **5 characters or less**
- Prefix cannot be empty or only whitespace
- Slash commands (`/`) **always work** regardless of custom prefix
::

::note
**Examples of Valid Prefixes**  
`!` • `.` • `?` • `>>` • `lum!` • `bot.`
