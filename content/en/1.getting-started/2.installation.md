[Add Lumière to Discord](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1308561238833364992&permissions=3162195407793655&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands){class="button-primary"}

## Installation Steps

### 1. Click the Invite Link

Use the button above or [this direct link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1308561238833364992&permissions=3162195407793655&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands) to open Discord's authorization page.

### 2. Select Your Server

Choose the server where you want to add Lumière from the dropdown menu. You'll need **Manage Server** permission to add bots.

### 3. Review Permissions

Lumière will request specific permissions to function properly. The invite link includes all necessary permissions for every feature to work seamlessly.

**Administrator Permission Recommended**

<br>

> While not strictly required, granting Administrator permission prevents silent failures and permission-related errors. This ensures all features work flawlessly without manual permission configuration.

**Why Administrator?**
- Eliminates permission conflicts
- Prevents features from breaking due to missing permissions
- Saves time troubleshooting role hierarchy issues
- Ensures logging captures all events without gaps

If you prefer granular control, you can modify permissions after installation—just be aware some features may require manual permission adjustments.

### 4. Authorize

Click **Authorize** and complete the verification if prompted. Lumière will appear in your server immediately.

### 5. Verify Installation

Once added, you should see:
- **Lumière appears in your member list** with an online status
- **A join message** in your server (if you have welcome messages enabled)
- **Access to slash commands** by typing `/` in any channel

## What's Next?

Lumière is now on your server, but it won't do anything until you configure it.

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Lumière isn't showing up
- Refresh your Discord client or restart the app

### Can't see slash commands
- Ensure Lumière has **Use Application Commands** permission
- Wait 5-10 minutes for Discord to sync commands
- Try typing `/` in a channel where Lumière has access

### Permission errors during setup
- Grant Lumière a role above the roles it needs to manage
- Give Lumière Administrator (recommended) or manually configure all required permissions
- Check [Permissions Guide](/getting-started/permissions) for detailed permission requirements
