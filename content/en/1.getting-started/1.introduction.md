# Welcome to Lumière

Lumière is an all-in-one Discord bot built to handle everything your server needs **moderation**, **automation**, and **engagement** without the bloat or complexity of juggling multiple bots.

## What Makes Lumière Different?

Most Discord bots either do one thing well or try to do everything poorly. Lumière takes a different approach: **powerful features that actually work together**, with setup so simple you'll be operational in minutes.

## Core Philosophy

**Fun, Chaos, Control.** Lumière gives you the tools to foster engagement, handle the unexpected, and maintain order all without **micromanaging**.

## What Lumière Offers

- **AFK System** — Auto-status when you're away
- **Live Counters** — Real-time member stats in channel names
- **Fun Commands** — /kiss, /slap, guess-the-number games and **more**
- **Joineroles** — Auto-assign roles to new *Members* and *Bots*
- **Logging System** — Track edits, deletions, and member activity
- **Starboard** — Highlight your community's best moments
- **TempVoice** — On-demand voice channels that auto-delete

More features coming as Lumière grows.
